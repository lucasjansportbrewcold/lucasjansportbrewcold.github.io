        <p>Hey Love, so sorry to see you are feeling frustrated about the job searching. I cant imagine how frustrated you must be after
          all this time spend trying without much of a result. It must be so so tiring to constantly be doingthe same thing over and over again.
          But babe keep remembering there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to get a job. Yes, it might be hard. And, yes you might need a lot of tries,
          but you are an amazing smart hard working girl and there will be companies that recognise that. You just gotta keep going for a little longer. 
          Promise me you won't be too hard on yourself babe, since there is already other people that pressure you more than enough. I am always here for you to
          support you, listen to your rants or uplift you when you are feeling down. Please don't ever feel like you are being a burde on me, because you are not
          and you will never be. 화이팅 자기!! 나 자랑스러워!!!</p>
