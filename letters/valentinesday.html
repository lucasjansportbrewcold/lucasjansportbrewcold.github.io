        <p>Hey my love, happy valentines day!! So happy to be spending this second valentines day together! Lets make it even better than the last oneüòâ And also, how about 
        making this the last one we celebrate during long distance?? I really hope maybe we can. Anywaysss, I am very happy to be spending this day with you babe and 
        I am so curious about your gift lol. I am so proud of us of how we have grown together and figured out more and more stuff together. We still have our differences
        and our own issues and preferences but we are handling them so much better. Let's always keep improving our relationship, 
        understanding each other more and more and growing even closer. This valentines might have still cost us a bit of energy and stress due to our differences, 
        but I know this will only help for next year and other years to come. Thank you for trying to understand my thoughts about all this and taking the time to figure it out with me. 
        I think we did a very good job and for me personally I feel a lot less stressed right now than I did earlier about these kind of days, thanks to your sweetness and understanding.
        I really think soon we will be able to have these without any of us feeling stressed or afraid to pressure the other person too much, as we get to know each others
        expectations and wants even better. We have both been busy lately, me while finishing my studies and you with your continued job searching, 
        so I am very happy we were able to make some time to celebrate this day together. I feel like this period of long distance since my last visit to Korea went by so quick and without
        any major discussions. We discuss our issues so healthy these days and I can really notice how we have grown closer too each other. Also when I have Jona over for example.
        In the past I felt quite stressed if I was still showing you enough attention when being with him or if I was calling enough, but this completely went away. I wanted to call you myself
        and I felt like you really just were happy for me that he was here and gave me the space to enjoy it. I didn't tell you, but that really means so much to me. Compared to earlier
        in our relationship it felt so stressfree and that made me so happy. Thank you so much for that babe, because I know this is something you also really had to get used to. 
        I really hope you can come to the Netherlands soon babe so we can experience living together again for a bit.
        I will finally be able to show you the Netherlands well and hopefully see you get more comfortable in my tiny country. Nijmegen can't wait for your visitüòò Let's have 
        a great day together, enjoy our presents and forget about our busy lives for a bit. I am so proud of us for how hard we are working on our relationship, but also on ourselves by looking for new challenges 
        and learning new things everyday. As long as we do it together I know we can handle everything coming at us. Ï†ïÎßê ÏÇ¨ÎûëÌï¥ ÏûêÍ∏∞. Ik hou van je en mis je elke dag. </p>
