        <p>Hey love, i know you would love to talk to me right now to share what is on your mind. Unfortunately I guess 
            I am busy right now and don't have time to listen. That's why i made this little page where you can write down whatever thought is bothering you and you want to share with me
            or if you have a funny or interesting story you just can't wait to tell me.❤️</p>
